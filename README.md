# MiniGPTChess

Minimal project for experimenting with a GPT-assisted chess engine.

## Client

`client/main.py` opens a PyGame window and renders a chess board using
Unicode pieces. The board state is stored as a FEN string so it can be
updated after each move.

Run the client:

```bash
python client/main.py
```
